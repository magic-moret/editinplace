jQuery to edit html-classes straight in the document. might be a little messy, but it works..

Ok.. so, i did this for work. 
Basicly it's some jquery functions that lets you edit plain html-text in the html-document.
By clicking the text you get a input-box where you can edit the text. Also did one where you click your text and you get
a dropdown where you can select a new value.
The newly edited text then gets set as a hidden-field for storage, and then a update function starts a backend function 
which takes these new values and saves them to the database. 
Like i said, its kinda messy but it works. took me like forever to get this shit all sorted out. hopefully someone may
find this helpful.
